# CPP-I-HW-1-1

## Overview
This repository contains the structure for completing homework questions HW1.1 through HW1.5 for C++ Programming I.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized with a separate directory for each homework question:

```
CPP-I-HW-1-1/
├── HW1.1/
│   ├── README.md    # Question and solution documentation
│   └── main.cpp     # C++ source code template
├── HW1.2/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── main.cpp
├── HW1.3/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── main.cpp
├── HW1.4/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── main.cpp
└── HW1.5/
    ├── README.md
    └── main.cpp
```

## How to Use

### 1. Navigate to the homework directory
```bash
cd HW1.X  # Replace X with the question number (1-5)
```

### 2. Add the homework question
Open the `README.md` file in the homework directory and paste the question in the designated section.

### 3. Implement your solution
Edit the `main.cpp` file to implement your solution.

### 4. Compile and run
```bash
g++ -o hw1_X main.cpp  # Replace X with the question number
./hw1_X
```

### 5. Document your work
Add any notes or explanations to the README.md file.

## Requirements
- C++ compiler (g++ recommended)
- Basic understanding of C++ programming

## Notes
- Each homework directory is self-contained
- README files include placeholders for questions and notes
- C++ template files include basic structure with comments for guidance
