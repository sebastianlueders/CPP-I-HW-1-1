HW 1.3 – Extra Credit

⚫ For additional credit on the previous problem, it
should be tastefully formatted. In particular

⚫ Use "brick-wall" formatting, in which the numbers of
each row are presented interleaved with the numbers
on the rows above and below.

⚫ The brick size should be the maximum size of any
integer in the triangle. For aesthetic as well as
technical reasons, it is useful if the brick size is odd,
so you may increase the size by one if necessary to
make this true.

⚫ Each number should be centered on its brick.

⚫ Hint: To get a number n centered in a field of width w,
use format("{:^{}}", n, w);
