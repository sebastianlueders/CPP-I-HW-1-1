HW 1.1

⚫ The purpose of this exercise is to help you make sure you have a
suitable C++ compiler installed and that you know how to build
programs and submit homework

⚫ All referenced code is available on canvas

⚫ Build, compile, and run the "Hello_personal",
"vector_simple_demo.cpp" and both "Frame" programs on your
compiler of choice.

⚫ You may need to follow some of the steps from the lecture for enabling
you to use format

⚫ Send something to demonstrate that you’ve done this
successfully (e.g., screenshots, any files you’ve written, including
C++ files, makefiles, Visual Studio project files, a transcript of
your shell session, etc.)

⚫ Do not submit any executable files or large binaries! They aren’t
any good for the graders
